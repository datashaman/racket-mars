An implementation of MARS, a Redcode emulator.

From Wikipedia:

> Core War is a programming game created by D. G. Jones and
> A. K. Dewdney in which two or more battle programs (called "warriors")
> compete for control of a virtual computer. These battle programs are
> written in an abstract assembly language called Redcode.

> At the beginning of a game, each battle program is loaded into memory
> at a random location, after which each program executes one instruction
> in turn. The object of the game is to cause the processes of opposing
> programs to terminate (which happens if they execute an invalid
> instruction), leaving the victorious program in sole possession
> of the machine.
